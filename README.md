# python-challenge
The work was done:

Created a new repository for this project called python-challenge. 
Cloned the new repository to my computer.

Inside my local Git repository, created a folder for each Python assignment and named them PyBank and PyPoll.

In each folder created, added the following content:

A new file called main.py. 

A Resources folder that contains the CSV files I used. 

An analysis folder that contains my text file that has the results from  analysis.

PyBank 
In this Challenge, Python script  analyzed the financial records of  company. The dataset is composed of two columns: "Date" and "Profit/Losses".

Task created a Python script that analyzed the records to calculate each of the following values:

The total number of months included in the dataset

The net total amount of "Profit/Losses" over the entire period

The changes in "Profit/Losses" over the entire period, and then the average of those changes

The greatest increase in profits (date and amount) over the entire period

The greatest decrease in profits (date and amount) over the entire period

Results:

PyPoll 
In this Challenge, I was tasked with helping a small, rural town modernize its vote-counting process.

It was given a set of poll data called election_data.csv. The dataset is composed of three columns: "Voter ID", "County", and "Candidate". I have created a Python script that analyzed the votes and calculates each of the following values:

The total number of votes cast

A complete list of candidates who received votes

The percentage of votes each candidate won

The total number of votes each candidate won

The winner of the election based on popular vote

Results:
